# üîÅ Python Iterators Study

This repository contains small but practical examples of Python iterators. The purpose of these examples is to understand how iteration works *without using `for` or `while` loops* ‚Äî focusing instead on `iter()`, `next()`, and implementing the iterator protocol using `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.

## üìÅ File Overview

| File Name          | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`          | A simple test file for manually working with `iter()` and `next()` on built-in iterables like lists. |
| `counter.py`       | Defines a custom `Counter` iterator that counts from 1 up to a given number.                        |
| `keyword_finder.py`| Defines `KeywordFinder`, which reads a file and yields lines containing a specified keyword.        |
| `linecounter.py`   | Defines `LineCounter`, which recursively counts total lines and words in a file.                    |
| `testfile.py`      | A sandbox file for testing the iterator classes.                                                    |
| `textfile.txt`     | A sample file used to test file-reading iterators.                     |

## üîß Iterators Included

### `Counter` ‚Äî Custom Number Generator
- **File:** `counter.py`
- **Description:** Yields numbers from 1 to `count`, one by one, using the iterator protocol and provids a method to print the same.

---

### `KeywordFinder` ‚Äî Filter Lines by Keyword
- **File:** `keyword_finder.py`
- **Description:** Reads a text file and yields only lines containing a specified keyword (case-insensitive). Tracks the number of matching lines. Provides a method to print the lines found with the given keyword along with the total lines found at the end.

---

### `LineCounter` ‚Äî Count Lines and Words in File
- **File:** `linecounter.py`
- **Description:** Recursively reads a file to count total lines and total words. Avoids use of loops by calling itself. Provides two methods to find the number of lines and number of words in the given file.

## üöÄ How to Run

Run the `testfile.py` script to test all iterator classes together:
Or run each file individually to explore how the iterators work in isolation.
